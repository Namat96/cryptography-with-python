# Cryptography with Python

This repository contains my **learning journey of cryptography implemented in Python**.
The goal of this repository is to understand **basic cryptographic concepts**
and implement them using **simple Python code**.

This work combines **mathematics, logic, and programming** and is part of my
preparation for advanced studies in **cryptography**.
